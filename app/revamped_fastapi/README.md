# The revamped whiser API

## Design

I will need:
* One REST API with FastAPI
* One Frontend, it will be a Typescript React frontend


### First try

I am going to follow https://www.gradio.app/guides/fastapi-app-with-the-gradio-client

I first need a nice docker image to run in dev mode

I might also use https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/

#### The search for a template ofcookie cutter

AndI start by searching for a good template:

* https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template : its got 38K stars, i use that one first with release `0.8.0`
